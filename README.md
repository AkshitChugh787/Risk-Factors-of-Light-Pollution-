# Risk-Factors-of-Light-Pollution
Light pollution comprises direct glare, chronically increased illumination and temporary,
unexpected fluctuations in lighting. The sources of ecological light pollution are very
various and found in nearly every ecosystem in the form of sky glow, illuminated
buildings and towers, streetlights, fishing boats, security lights, lights on vehicles, flares
on offshore oil platforms, and even lights on undersea research vessels. Among all causes
having a negative effect on night sky quality, light pollution shows the highest immediate
risks.
The Skyglow, is an omnipresent sheet of light across the night sky in and around cities
that can block all but the very brightest stars from view. Plants and animals depend on
Earth’s daily cycle of light and dark rhythm to govern life-sustaining behaviors such as
reproduction, nourishment, sleep and protection from predators.
Scientific evidence suggests that artificial light at night has negative and deadly effects on
many creatures including amphibians, birds, mammals, insects and plants.
To prevent further global declines in biodiversity, identifying and understanding key 
habitats is crucial for successful conservation strategies. For example, globally, seabird
populations are under threat and animal movement data can identify key at sea areas and
provide valuable information on the state of marine ecosystems. To date, in order to
locate these areas, studies have used global positioning system (GPS) to record position
and are sometimes combined with time–depth recorder (TDR) devices to identify diving
activity associated with foraging, a crucial aspect of at-sea behaviour. However, the use of
additional devices such as TDRs can be expensive, logistically difficult and may
adversely affect the animal. Alternatively, behaviours may be resolved from
measurements derived from the movement data alone. However, this behavioural analysis
frequently lacks validation data for locations predicted as foraging (or other behaviours).
Mapping these predictions provides useful insights into the foraging activity of a range of
seabird species, highlighting important at sea locations. These models have the potential
to be used to analyse historic GPS datasets and further our understanding of how
environmental changes have affected these seabirds over time.
